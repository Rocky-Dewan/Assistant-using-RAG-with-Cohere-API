# Assistant-using-RAG-with-Cohere-API
This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using the LangChain framework and Cohere API. It allows users to ask questions about real estate properties (e.g., "What is the rental yield of Greenview Estate?"), and answers are generated based on document data stored in a local directory.
